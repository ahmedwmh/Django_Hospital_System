## 🔧 **The Problem:**
Your app is 100% working on Digital Ocean, but your local network can't connect to it.

**Think of it like this:**
- Your app is like a restaurant that's open and serving customers
- But your car (browser) can't find the road to get there
- The restaurant is fine - it's a navigation problem
